PBJKaraoke
==========

NOTE: This software is in a very early state of development. Its requirements, behaviour and general architecture are likely to change drastically over the course of development, even in later releases, as it will constantly be adjusted to our needs. Feel free to provide us with suggestions anyway. ;)

1. Overview

    PBJKaraoke is designed to provide a control for video and image viewing software as well as a content grabber that is usable as a karaoke system. The main purpose is to provide another machine with simple command-line controls over a running instance of PBJKaraoke on another machine dedicated to viewing.

2. Requirements

    Not entirely clear as of yet.
   * feh 
   * mplayer 
   * youtube-dl

3. Installation

    Drop into a folder, adjust the settings and run.
    Although the settings should (ideally) be documented in the code, there will (ideally) be more useful information here in the future.

4. The future

    ... will bring anything that appears to be useful as a feature to this software, unless we don't come up with it or simply are too lazy to implement it.
